## Project History
NextQuad was born from the common frustration of NYU students struggling to:
- Find available study spaces during peak hours
- Connect safely with verified campus community members
- Stay informed about dorm-specific events and announcements
- Buy/sell items within a trusted student network

Our team came together in Oct 2025 as part of the Agile Software Development & DevOps course to build a solution that addresses these pain points.

## Core Features

- Verified .edu email signup with dorm-based groups
- Categorized bulletin board (Lost & Found, Roommate Requests, Buy/Sell)
- Campus event feed with RSVP functionality
- Student marketplace for safe peer-to-peer trading
- Real-time safety alerts integrated with campus security
- Study Space Finder (interactive campus map, reservation, building infos, etc.)
